    <h2>The display property</h2>

    <div id="block">
        Block Element, fills a whole line. Div is the standard block level element, 
        semantic block level elements are: header, footer, section, etc.
    </div>

    <div id="inline">
        Inline element, wraps <span>some text/content inside a paragraph</span> without 
        disrupting the flow of that paragraph.The default inline element is the <span>span</span>, 
        but another example is the anchor tag element.
    </div>

    <div>
        An exotic display type is "none", an element with display "none" will make the page 
        render it as the element doesn't exist. This is different from "visibility: hidden;",
        which will hide the element, but it will continue taking space on the page, like an visible element would.
    </div>

    <h2>Ways to center stuff</h2>

    <div id="width_margin0auto">
        "margin: 0 auto;" and "width: 400px". Centers an element. The element will take the specified width, 
        and then the remaining space will be evenly divided between the left and right margin.
        But, there is a problem, if the current window size is smaller than the width you've set, the browser
        will use a scrollbar to navigate between the screen, which is bad (at least IMO, not very responsive :( )
    </div>

    <div id="maxwidth_margin0auto">
        "margin: 0 auto;" and "max-width: 400px". It also centers an element, buuut, 
        if the screen size is smaller than the specified max-width, 
        the element will shrink to a smaller size, in order to fit the screen size. 
        It improves the responsivity on smaller devices! :D
        The element size will take at most the specified max-width, but no more than. 
        This way, the browser can set a smaller width if it needs to.
    </div>
