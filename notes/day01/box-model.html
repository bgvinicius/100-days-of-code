    <div class="orange">
        Everything on the screen is treated like a box, and this box has: margin, padding and a border.
    </div>

    <div>
        Box model. Be careful when setting widths, because, sometimes, the element may end up bigger 
        than originally planned, that happens because the element can have some extra padding and borders, 
        which stretch the element beyond the original width. See 
        <a href="http://learnlayout.com/box-model.html" target="_blank">box-model.</a>
        For some time, people used to workaround this using smaller widths, subtracting the padding and border. But that's not very good :c
    </div>

    <div class="no-padding-no-border">
        Here, a box with width "500" and no padding & border set.
    </div>

    <div class="with-padding-border">
        Now, a box with width "500", 50px padding and 10px border width. Not the same width, huh? :(
    </div>

    <div>
        To fix the previous problem, a new css property was created, the box-sizing property. 
        With the box-sizing property, you can set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, and then, 
        the padding and border of that element will no longer increase its width. 
    </div>

    <div class="box-sizing-only">
        Now, 500px width, without padding & border width set but using box-sizing: border-box
    </div>

    <div class="box-sizing-padding-border">
        Aaand, again, using 500px width, 50px padding, 10px border width, but now 
        with border-box box sizing. Same width! Yay =D
    </div>
