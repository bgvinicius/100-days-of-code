<body>
    <div id="static">
        We can have "position: static;" which is the default value for this property. 
        The element isn't positionated in any special way, and an element with "static" position
        is said to be not positionated, and an element with any other value for "position" 
        is said to be positionated.
    </div>

    <div id="relative1">
        Relative (position: relative;) behaves the same way as "static", unless you add some extra properties.
        (top, right, bottom, left)
    </div>

    <div id="relative2">
        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to 
        be adjusted away from its normal position. 
        Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. 
    </div>

    <div>
        (See, there is a gap between this element and the above element)
    </div>

    <div id="fixed">
        Fixed (position: fixed;) places the element relative to the viewport, which means it
        always stays at the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
        We also use the top, right, left and bottom properties with the fixed position.
        Fixed elements doesn't leave a gap on their original position, to there is no problem here.
    </div>

    <div>(See fixed element at bottom of screen, also, see, no gap here!! Yay =D)</div>

    <div>Absolute (position: absolute;) absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest 
        positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. 
        If an absolutely-positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
        it uses the document body, and still moves along with page scrolling.</div>

    <div id="relative3">
        This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; 
        its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body. 

        <div id="absolute">
            This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent. 
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="not-positionated">
        This element isn't positionated (position: static), so its children will 
        be positionated relative to the document body.
        <div id="absolute2">
            An absolutely-positionated 
            element relative to the document body (because its parent element isn't positionated)
        </div>
    </div>
