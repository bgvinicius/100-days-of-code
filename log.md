# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1 - Vinicius Bernardo

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Started on April 22, 2019.

### Day 1: April 22, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Exercised CSS foundations, block vs inline elements, centering elements with margin 0 auto, using max-width to add responsivity on smaller screens, side-effects of using width with the box model, the box-sizing property (new to me), and CSS positions (static, relative, fixed, absolute)

**Thoughts:** Today was mostly a review of some stuff I've already studied but wasn't very fresh in my mind. I've also learned a new property (box-sizing) and how to use the position property properly! Feeling very happy right now :D
