# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1 - Vinicius Bernardo

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Started on April 22, 2019.

### Day 1: April 22, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Exercised CSS foundations, block vs inline elements, centering elements with margin 0 auto, using max-width to add responsivity on smaller screens, side-effects of using width with the box model, the box-sizing property (new to me), and CSS positions (static, relative, fixed, absolute)

**Thoughts:** Today was mostly a review of some stuff I've already studied but wasn't very fresh in my mind. I've also learned a new property (box-sizing) and how to use the position property properly! Feeling very happy right now :D

### Day 2: April 23, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Still exercising CSS layouts fundamentals, today I've made a quick recap on box-model (margin, padding, box-sizing) & layouts made using positions. After that, I studied the float property, clear, and also the clearfix hack (with overflow: auto). Now, I have homework to do (tomorrow, it will be my recap of floats): create a layout using floats.

**Thoughts:** Today was slightly harder than yesterday. I think it was because my mind was pushing me towards relax & study later, but I've sat down and sent that procrastination away! I've also had some difficulties understanding floats & clear, but I managed to understand everything, tomorrow I will review and stick it into my mind!

### Day 3: April 24, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did my review about CSS floats, recreating a simple layout using floats. After that, I've written my first media query ever! After that,  I wrote a grid of boxes using floats, then recreated this same grid using inline-block display. I also wrote and tested some differences between inline & inline-block display.

**Thoughts:** I felt that today was a very rewarding day. My third day on the challenge, I was a bit tired on the moment I started, but now I'm feeling very energized & happy with my progress. I liked the things I've made today, really happy about it!

### Day 4: April 25, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did a quick recap about inline-block displays, then learned how to use the column-count & column-gap properties to create multi-column text. After that, I've been studying and practicing flexbox.

**Thoughts:** It was a bit hard to start again, but I think that happened because I'm a bit sick today. Anyways, feeling happy about fulfilling my duty :)

### Day 5: April 26, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed Flexbox and created a layout using it, and started implementing my survey form project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I was tired today, and I also got late at home. So, I didn't do much today, but it's still better than nothing. Tomorrow I'll finish the survey form project from FCC.

### Day 6: April 27, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I used flexbox to create the layout of my survey form project. I styled almost everything on the page. Now, I have to give a little more attention to the fonts and spacing between some elements.

**Thoughts:** I could have accomplished more if I had started the challenge earlier. But it was good anyways, I had a hard time making the layout, but I managed to make it work.

### Day 7: April 28, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Survey Form project from FreecodeCamp! With my girlfriend help, I improved the design and layout of the page. I also learned a little about color theory.

**Thoughts**: It was a great day today, feeling super! I also realized that I need to practice more about styling inputs because they're very annoying to style.

### Day 8: April 29, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Product Landing Page project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I got home late and tired today, so I didn't progress a lot today on my project.

### Day 9: April 30, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Improved the layout of my Product Landing Page, but there is still some work left to do on the page layout.

**Thoughts**: It would have been better if I had planned my page previously, designing the page while coding is counterproductive. Tomorrow I'll think more about the design before implementing.

### Day 10: May 1, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the remaining issues with the navbar, now everything is in place on the website. Now I have to style individual things like buttons, define the colors, etc.

**Thoughts**: Had some problems to focus today, because I wanted to rest the whole day. It would have been better if I started working on the challenge earlier today.

### Day 11: May 2, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Styled the texts from the page, worked on the navbar fonts, sizes, and spaces. I also created a hover effect on the navbar buttons that made me feel like a boss (lmao).

**Thoughts**: Well, I'm very proud of my focus today. I sat down and worked focused for an hour, without distractions. Hopefully, I'll make it again on the weekend! The thing is: prepare a distraction-free atmosphere, use rainymood.com, and focus :)

### Day 12: May 3, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: I styled the features section of the page. I also made some improvements on the typography, using a new font.

**Thoughts**: Good day! I was tired, but I managed to focus and produce something. I'm very thrilled about this. I used the same strategy from yesterday, prepare the atmosphere, use rainymood.com/some background music, and then start working.

### Day 13: May 4, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Product Landing Page project from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good about the result of the project :) I did everything early on the day, following my focus strategy, which is doing wonders for me!

### Day 14: May 5, 2019 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Technical Documentation project from freecodecamp. Implemented the initial layout, and styled some elements of the page.

**Thoughts**: Today I wasn't in the mood to work, but I did my part anyways. Fulfilled my duty!

**Today's Progress**: Styled some boxes from the page, improved the font color of the content and used JS to create a toggle effect on the navbar buttons.
