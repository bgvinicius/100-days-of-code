# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1 - Vinicius Bernardo

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Started on April 22, 2019.

### Day 1: April 22, 2019 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Exercised CSS foundations, block vs inline elements, centering elements with margin 0 auto, using max-width to add responsivity on smaller screens, side-effects of using width with the box model, the box-sizing property (new to me), and CSS positions (static, relative, fixed, absolute)

**Thoughts:** Today was mostly a review of some stuff I've already studied but wasn't very fresh in my mind. I've also learned a new property (box-sizing) and how to use the position property properly! Feeling very happy right now :D

### Day 2: April 23, 2019 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Still exercising CSS layouts fundamentals, today I've made a quick recap on box-model (margin, padding, box-sizing) & layouts made using positions. After that, I studied the float property, clear, and also the clearfix hack (with overflow: auto). Now, I have homework to do (tomorrow, it will be my recap of floats): create a layout using floats.

**Thoughts:** Today was slightly harder than yesterday. I think it was because my mind was pushing me towards relax & study later, but I've sat down and sent that procrastination away! I've also had some difficulties understanding floats & clear, but I managed to understand everything, tomorrow I will review and stick it into my mind!

### Day 3: April 24, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did my review about CSS floats, recreating a simple layout using floats. After that, I've written my first media query ever! After that,  I wrote a grid of boxes using floats, then recreated this same grid using inline-block display. I also wrote and tested some differences between inline & inline-block display.

**Thoughts:** I felt that today was a very rewarding day. My third day on the challenge, I was a bit tired on the moment I started, but now I'm feeling very energized & happy with my progress. I liked the things I've made today, really happy about it!
